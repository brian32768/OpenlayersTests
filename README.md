# OpenlayersTests
Samples of versions of Openlayers apps

I needed to get up to speed with Openlayers 5
but could not get examples to work so I built
a series of my own examples to test everything.

If you have Parcel installed then all the package dependencies should get
installed for you.

````bash
  npm install -g parcel-bundler
````

## Run test

So far I don't have this top level
package running, so cd into ol5 and do this.

````bash
  npm start
````
